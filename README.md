# MRSI-CPCA
# This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline for a research project focused on identifying spectral pattern differences between individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and non-hyperintensity controls using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI). We apply Contrastive Principal Component Analysis (cPCA) to highlight variations unique to the MS cohort.
